        <h4>Foundations Core Skills</h4>

    <div class=main>

    <div class=subheading><p>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p></div>
        
        <p>I have learned how important many of the practices of nueroplasticity training are in relation to my own general mental health and welbeing.</p>
        
        <p>The identity, values and strengths activity was very interesting. 
            It had been a long time since I had to take stock on alot of those things and it was interesting to see 
            what had and hadn't changed since I had.</p>
        
    <div class=subheading><p>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p></div>
        
        <p>Values I think define how you work and what you are willing to work on, so in the context of programming, the values of a particular project,
            group or organization must be assesed against your own to evaluate if the project or team is the right fit for you and that you 
            are the right progammer for the project.
        </p>
        <p>Empathy is vital for working with others, in programming or any collaborative work,  as it's what really allows us to hear and understand others, 
            coupled with compassion and respect its what allows us to reconcile our ideas and goals with others.</p>
    
        <p>Self-awarenes is key for the way it contributes to a better understanding of empathy and personal values, but also
            In having the knowledge to honestly communicate your abbilities and limitiations both technically and personally to those 
            you may be undertaking a collaborative project with.
        </p>
        
    <div class=subheading><p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p></div>
        
        <p>I was surprised to see wellbeing and sustainable working and learning habits as such a focus of the course initially,
            but have bennefited greatly from this being the case I feel.
        </p>

        <p>I have certainly had to reasses some of what I thought I knew about my learning style and whats best for me.
            I realized I still carried a rather toxic attitude that wellbeing and a learning style that worked for me were mutually
            exclusive.
        </p>
        <p>These preconceptions were larely based in my experiences learning as a much younger person, I feel my professional 
            experiences over the last decade have greatly influenced how I now see wellbeing and mindfulness as a fundamental aspect
            positive learning and working habits.
        </p>


        
    <div class=subheading><p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p></div>
        
        <p>It involved a lot of self assessment and reflection which I found difficult given some personal circimstance.</p>
        <p>I have only recently moved back to New Zealand and have found it hard with the large focus on structure and practice in much
           of the material while feeling quite unsettled and not established myself in my personal life, also lacking routine recently.
        </p>
        
    <div class=subheading><p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p></div>
        
        <p>Producing graduates that are incredibly proficient in coding would be irrelivant if they did not possess the emotional intelligence and practices
            to take into a colloborative and professional environment.</p>
        
        <p>The core learning practices are aimed at giving graduates the skills needed to maintain themselves and their 
            wellbeing longterm, as well as the skills needed to collaberate and operate in a proffessional sense.
        </p>

    <div class=subheading><p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</p></div>
      
        <p>It did not feel like a waste of time, I am already benefiting from some of the practices I have learned and understand how
            many of the core teachings are aimed at establishing practices and methods that can be viably taken forward into a career setting.

    <h4>Identity, Values and Strengths</h4>
    
    <div class=main>
    
    <p>
      My core personal values are empathy, compassion loyalty and integrity and as a person a try to adhere strongly to these values; Empathy is vital for working with others as its what really allows us to hear and understand others, coupled with compassion and respect its what allows us to reconcile our ideas with others.										I’m often described as a very loyal person, but I take having made commitments seriously, emotional commitments to family and friends most of all.				Integrity is perhaps the most important, as core values can mean very little without the motivation and conviction to follow them at all times.
      The Briggs-Meyers personality test classifies me as introverted, intuitive, feeling and perceiving, and I largely agree;
		<span>    
      
    </span>“INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and 				 beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment 	   is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and 				 pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair.						 INFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned 		 with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and 			 nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path.”

      As a film festival projectionist and was often asked by organisers to cut the films credits from the screening, this was a professional problem for me as its very much part of my job as a projectionist to play the film as agreed in its entirety, however as an employee its also my job to take direction from the organisers; more importantly it was an ethical decision for me as I believe it is wrong to not give credit to the many people who contribute.

I refused to cut the credits as the stated purpose of the festival was to highlight and profile indigenous and first nations filmmakers and I found it unethical not to include their names with their work.

The credits were played, I was cautioned by my employer and asked to comply with such requests in future. I continued to always show credits as I believe it ethical for those who created to work to receive credit. </p>
    <p>
      Both of my parents immigrated here from Northern Ireland in the 1980s
      And I believe their Irish heritage has had a large influence of my core personal values.
      I grew up in a large community and was always taught it was part of our culture to be hospitable, welcoming and supportive.
      
      As a young adult I was part of the diy/punk community in Hamilton and Wellington, here I was also greatly influenced by the ethics and values I was exposed to; such as a focus on inclusive and egalitarian accessibility to events and projects.
    </p>
    
    <p>Strengths I see as valuable in my learning and career development:
      I am reflective by nature and find this an asset with creative thinking and problem solving; I value cooperation, communication and compromise, so find I work and collaborate with others well.
      
      I am passionate and this generally translates to a strong work ethic and dedication to projects I have undertaken personally and professionally.
      I value integrity and take responsibility for my work and try to work to a high personal standard; I can however also become disillusioned with projects I see as not being in line with my core values.
      
      “INFPs have a tendency to neglect or suppress their own needs if they believe it is necessary to keep the peace or make others happy.”
      
      I have a tendency to get wrapped up in projects I care about and this can lead to working and learning patterns that are unsustainable as they see me neglect a lot of my wellbeing and self care.
      While I love throwing myself at creative challenges I can become overwhelmed when I care deeply about the project at hand.</p>
  
      <p>My work involved collaboration with outside technicians and organisers for one off and ongoing events. It involved a lot of logistics and changes to the agreed delivery plan were often met with heavy resistance.

        It was important to always be empathetic and understand each persons concern, communication was key to settling many disputes as teams often worked autonomously from one another.
        Coming together and taking a step back to refocus on the overall goal of the event we were trying to deliver rather than each teams key duties helped each team work for the common goal and see each others teams as doing the same.
        
        I still believe in this practice and think a short face to face talk about goals can save an incredible amount of time and energy when working collaboratively.
        
        Something I would focus more on now would be communicating about why we started in the first place.
        Duties can be so varied and divided on large projects that people can start to feel divided, I think its important to remember that even though such structures can feel isolating and lead to division, you are all likely there because you had something common in the first place. </p>

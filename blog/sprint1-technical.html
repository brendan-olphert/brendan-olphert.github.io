      My core personal values are empathy, compassion loyalty and integrity and as a person a try to adhere strongly to these values; Empathy is vital for working with others as its what really allows us to hear and understand others, coupled with compassion and respect its what allows us to reconcile our ideas with others.										I’m often described as a very loyal person, but I take having made commitments seriously, emotional commitments to family and friends most of all.				Integrity is perhaps the most important, as core values can mean very little without the motivation and conviction to follow them at all times.
      The Briggs-Meyers personality test classifies me as introverted, intuitive, feeling and perceiving, and I largely agree;

    </span>“INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and 				 beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment 	   is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and 				 pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair.						 INFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned 		 with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and 			 nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path.”

      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

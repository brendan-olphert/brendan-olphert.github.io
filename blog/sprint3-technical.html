    <h4>Sprint 3 - Technical</h4>

    <div class=main>
      
      <p>As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:</p>

        <div class=subheading><p>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p></div>
        
        <p>The relationship between HTML and CSS are kind of like a house. Think of HTML as the slab and frame, 
            they are what make the house a stucture in the firstplace.</p>
        
        <p>CSS is like the cladding or walls and tiles, It is what you see when you look at the house,
           and is how you might describe the house to others, but they are really functional and 
           stylistic fixures on the frame.
        </p>
        
        <div class=subheading><p>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</p></div>
        
        <p>answer</p>
        <div class=subheading><p>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</p></div>
        
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an underlying hierachal structure that allows used to allow interactivity and interface between 
          Java-Script, HTML, and CSS.
        
        The DOM represents the document as Nodes, each of which relate to and element (or attribute etc) in the HTML or CSS</p>
        <p>An example of how you might interact with the DOM is through use of the developer tools functionality in browsers such as Chrome</p>
        
        <div class=subheading><p>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p></div>
        
        <p>The properties in an object can be accessed with dot and bracket notation e.g. object.key[value]</p>
        <p>The properties in an array are arranged using zero-based indexing and can be accessed by calling their number in the list hierachy </p>
        
        <div class=subheading><p>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</p></div>
        
        <p>Functions are alot like brackets in mathematics, they group or wrap parts of code. Arguments and code contained within the wrap or group
          are excecuted as a group by the Java-Script engine. I have been thinking it like if your code is a list of instructions for your computer to read,
          a function is like a self contained task for the engine to carry out before moving on down the tree.</p>

        <p>Functions are incredibly useful. They carry out tasks that save alot of code.</p>

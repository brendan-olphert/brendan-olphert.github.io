<!--Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

Got blocked on a simple problem
Solved a problem in an elegant way.
In both cases:

What was the problem?
What problem solving techniques did you use?
How did you feel throughout the process?
What did you learn?-->
<p>
    I became suprisingly blocked on a very simple problem in the reflections for this week, it presented a simple 
    if/else and asked that I write a function that would print pass.
</p>
<p>
    Firstly I tried explaining to my housemate what I was trying to do and what I thought I needed to do, 
    basically using him as a rubber duck. I then wrote out what the function would need to do on paper and began 
    researching/remembering the commands I would need. I set up a test space (REPL.IT) to work in and tried it out.
</p>
<p>
    It didnt work, The function I had been provided was simple and should produce a pass with what i had sent it.
    I checked my code and still found the commands I used what I thought I should use.

    I became frustrated at this point and discussed it with a peer from the course, we compared experience and found 
    we had both done more than we needed to.
</p>
<p>
    Basically I had gotten so focused on one part of the function that I thought would require a fix that i hadnt stepped
    back and seen the rather simple solution in front of me of just using the funtion I was presented with. 
</p>
<p>
    I learned I need to stop getting ahead of myself and look at the problem for what it is and not how difficult I think
    its going to be.
</p>
<!--Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process-->
<div><h4 class=subheading>Problem Solving Techniques</h4></div>

<p>
    <p class=subheading>Pseudocode</p>
    <p>
        I am fairly confident with Pseudocode, I have been breaking down blocking out what I need to do on paper alot anyway.
    </p>
<p class=subheading>Trying something</p>
    <p>
        I love getting through workshops and trying things out, getting to a level where you understand the concepts
        enough to learn by trial and error is something I really enjoy.
    </p>
    <p class=subheading>Rubber ducky method</p>
    <p>
        I really like this idea, I feel like im going to use my cat instead though, but i think its a great first step 
        before pseudocode.
    </p>

<p class=subheading>Reading error messages</p>
    <p>
        I find these hugely helpful and they have gotten me through alot of the kata challenges this week, 
        it's kind of my go to.
    </p>
<p class=subheading>Console.logging</p>
    <p>
        I have not actually done heaps of this but I am starting to, so its probably to process im least confident but 
        can see myself using it alot more in sprint five.
    </p>
<p class=subheading>Googling</p>
<p>
    Been doint alot of this lately!,and im confident in how to research what i'm after, but the foundations sprints have 
    left me with some pretty excellent resourses I have bookmarked also.
</p>
<p class=subheading>Asking your peers and coaches for help</p>
<p>
    Always a must! Its important to have a go and review your work but the people around you are an incredible resource
    and I have had plenty of help.

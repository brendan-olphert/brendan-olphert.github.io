    <h4>Learning Plan</h4>

    <div class=main>

    <p class=subheading> Goals</p>

      <p>I wish to develop my interpersonal and communication skills relating to working collaboratively. I also wish to focus on 
         time management and develop healthier working habbits.
         In terms of career I would just like to be hired, I have been a casual employee my whole life.
      </p>
      
      <p class=subheading>Strengths and Limitations</p>
      
      <ul class=s2clist>
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <li>Respectful and Empathetic</li>
            <li>Value communication and collaboration</li>
            <li>Keen work ethic</li>
            <li>Creative thinker</li>
            <li>Personable</li>
            <li>Nonjudgemental</li>

        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
          <li>Poor time management</li>
          <li>Poor sleep patterns</li>
          <li>Can focus on 'bigger picture' and lose sight of smaller individual tasks that need to be taken</li>
          <li>Unsustainable working habbits</li>
          <li>Unfocussed</li>
          <li>Introverted</li></ul>

      <p class=subheading>Workload Management</b></p>
          <p>
            I intend on being very habitual in my approach to this course. At the start of each sprint I will read through what is required
             and break down the weeks workload into practical tasks, I picked up a habit of using task management software Trello in my last job
             and have been making up a trello board for each sprint at the start of the week. while this takes some time I find it helps me engage with
             and understand what is expected of me and what I can expect it terms of managing my workload.
             I have also started utilising timekeeping software to manage breaks and I set small goals of what units I should have completed on certain 
             days at the start of each week. 
          </p>
      
        <p class=subheading>Wellbeing and Support</p>
        <p>
          I try to be very aware of my limitations and know myself well in this sense, as such I acknowledge my limits and seek help and support.
        </p>

        <p>
          A big part of me relocating to Auckland to undertake this course was that my family and friends are in this city, I thought it best
           to have a support network around me while undertaking this course. My old friend and housemate is also currently completing foundations
           and I am finding havinf someone to relate to and reflect on the course with invaluable.
        </p>

      <p class=subheading>Scheduling</p>
        <p>I fortunately have no other major commitments while undertaking the course, I was working weekends and had planned
                on doing so throughout foundations but they are very late night shifts, so while I have the time to work the shifts I am finding
                the effect the 4am finishes have on my sleep cylcles for the next few days unsustainable. as such I no longer plan on working no more
                than one shift a week and only if I can work an earlier shift. i will also be finishing up there entirely sooner than expected.
                Having just recently moved here I also have very little social commitments.</p>
                
                <p>I intend on keeping sundays blocked out to see my family and friends but I still like to look over my (hopefully finished)
                work on sunday evenings.I plan on structuring my week every monday and set personal deadlines and goals throughout the week.</p>

                <p>I have largely worked evenings in life so im very used to getting alot of work done late into the evening, I wish to focus on 
                  what 'kind' of work I do and when. I am already finding mornings a much better time for me to deal with reflections and self assment 
                  and the nights far more suited to workshops and practical coding.
                </p>

  <p class=subheading>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>

  <p>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? 
      What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</p>
      
        <p>I do not have a specific destination in mind, but a large part of my choosing coding was the freedom of movement a 
        career in coding could afford me comparied to my previous field and the ability to work collaboratively.
      </p>
        <p>I would like to leave with the skills to build or develop websites for friends or professionally.</p>
        <p>My technical skills in my previous field were very specific, I wish to have a broader range of skills to be able to contribute to
          things i am passionate about. </p>
  
  <p class=subheading>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>

      <p>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? 
        Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</p>

      <p>After reflection I still feel I will struggle with many of the same limitations, such as poor time management and inability to focus at times,
         I have struggled already during foundations and if anything I am feeling more anxious after foundations.I will need to rely heavily on
        a learning plan.
      </p>

      <p>Many of the strengths I refer to earlier are not really utilised in self directed study so i am looking forward to working with a group.</p>
      <p>I anicipate I will struggle a bit getting used to the new schedule of working from campus.</p>
  
      <p class=subheading>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>

      <p>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.

  <p class=subheading>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>

      <p>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?

      <p>For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.

  <p class=subheading>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>

      <p>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.

  <p class=subheading>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>

      <p>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?

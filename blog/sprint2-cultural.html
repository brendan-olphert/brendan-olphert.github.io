    <h4>Learning Plan</h4>

    <div class=main>

    <p class=subheading> Goals</p>

      <p>I wish to develop my interpersonal and communication skills relating to working collaboratively. I also wish to focus on 
         time management and develop healthier working habbits.
         In terms of career I would just like to be hired, I have been a casual employee my whole life.
      </p>
      
      <p class=subheading>Strengths and Limitations</p>
      
      <ul><p><b>Strengths</b>
                <li>Respectful and Empathetic</li>
                <li>Value communication and collaboration</li>
                <li>Keen work ethic</li>
                <li>Creative thinker</li>

                          <li>Can focus on 'bigger picture' and lose sight of smaller individual tasks that need to be taken</li>

                          <li>Introverted</li></ul></p> 
      <p class=subheading>Workload Management</b></p>
                        <p>I intend on being very habitual in my approach to this course. At the start of each sprint I will read through what is required
                          and break down the weeks workload into practical tasks, I picked up a habit of using task management software Trello in my last job
                          and have been making up a trello board for each sprint at the start of the week. while this takes some time I find it helps me engage with
                          and understand what is expected of me and what I can expect it terms of managing my workload.
                          I have also started utilising timekeeping software to manage breaks and I set small goals of what units I should have completed on certain days at the start of each week. 
                        </p>
      
        <p class=subheading>Wellbeing and Support</p>

        <p>I try to be very aware of my limitations and know myself well in this sense, as such I acknowledge my limits and seek help and support.</p>

        <p>A big part of me relocating to Auckland to undertake this course was that my family and friends are in this city, I thought it best
           to have a support network around me while undertaking this course. My old friend and housemate is also currently completing foundations
           and I am finding havinf someone to relate to and reflect on the course with invaluable.
          </p>

          <p class=subheading>Scheduling</p>
              <p>I fortunately have no other major commitments while undertaking the course, I was working weekends and had planned
                on doing so throughout foundations but they are very late night shifts, so while I have the time to work the shifts I am finding
                the effect the 4am finishes have on my sleep cylcles for the next few days unsustainable. as such I no longer plan on working no more
                than one shift a week and only if I can work an earlier shift. i will also be finishing up there entirely sooner than expected.
                Having just recently moved here I also have very little social commitments.</p>
                
                <p>I intend on keeping sundays blocked out to see my family and friends but I still like to look over my (hopefully finished)
                work on sunday evenings.I plan on structuring my week every monday and set personal deadlines and goals throughout the week.</p>

                <p>I have largely worked evenings in life so im very used to getting alot of work done late into the evening, I wish to focus on 
                  what 'kind' of work I do and when. I am already finding mornings a much better time for me to deal with reflections and self assment 
                  and the nights far more suited to workshops and practical coding.

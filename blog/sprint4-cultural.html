<h4>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h4>

    <div class=main>

      <div><h4 class=subheading>Benefits of Understanding</h4></div>

<!--Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people-->

<p>
    An understanding of the principles of neuroplasticity befefits people be showing them that with practice, 
    neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. 
    These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, 
    such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.

    It gives people the confidence of knowing that through positive attitude and habbits they can recover and improve.
</p>

<div><h4 class=subheading>Engaging with the principles of Neuroplasticity</h4></div>
<!--Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit-->
<p>
    I would like to structure my sleep better and set a time to stop working in the evenings, I get alot done in the mornings
    and would like to be well rested for that time. Yoga is something I have been engaging with more, I have a bad back 
    anyhow, so it makes sense to stretch and take some time before and after working.
</p>

<!--Research Growth Mindset-->

<!--Discuss what it is and why it is relevant-->
<div><h4 class=subheading>Growth Mindset</h4></div>
<p>
    Growth mindset is a term used by Carol S. Dweck in regards to psycological attitudes towards intelligence and ability.
    As opposed to a kind of Fixed mindset, which traditionally favors traditional IQ testing as a measure for future ability, 
    Growth mindset is the understanding that through effort and positive practices and habits our brains can be trained and
    our abilities and learning can improve.
</p>
<!--In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?-->
<p>
    I was suprised to see how similar alot of the materials and excersises around neroplasticity were 
    to practices and hibits to manage depression.
</p>
<!--How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?-->
<div><h4 class=subheading>Intergrating Growth Mindset</h4></div>
<p>
    I would like to impliment the habits I mentioned as part of the nuroplasticity practices alongside a larger focus 
    on growth mindset when encountering problems or becoming frustrated.

<!--Blend with your learning plan and strategies-->
<!--Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.-->
<div><h4 class=subheading>Influence on my Learning Plan</h4></div>
<p>
    Its a very good way to frame your abilities and skills in relation to learning, I can see myself relying on it when I do encounter
    setbacks and find it has a very positive effect on my ability to problem solve and view the setback as rewarding if 
    I learned something or was able to solve it.
